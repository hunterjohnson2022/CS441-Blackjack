This is a semester long project for CS441 CSUSM

BLACKJACK - HOW TO PLAY:
-----------------------------------------------
The goal of this card game is to defeat the dealer.
The dealer is defeated when the player's cards are added together and come closer to 21 than the dealer's total.

A player loses if their total exceeds 21.
Choosing to "HIT" will draw another card which can put the player closer to 21 to increase the odds of winning, however, this can also cause the player
to exceed 21 and immediately lose.

Choosing "STAY" will end the game and either the player or dealer will win. 

The inital bet is doubled on a win and all money is lost on a loss
